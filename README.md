# Test Minecraft Plugin

A plugin that helps me learn Java with the use of Spigot API (allowed the interaction of the vanilla Minecraft).

## Usage

| Commands | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
/hello [health] | Says Hello back and reset health to [health]
/trolltoggle | Toggle to allow/disallow player's movement
